# Udagram: Project Overview

Starter code was provided by Udacity including the api and frontend of Udagram, an Instagram-like app, as the focus of this project was deploying the app. In this project, I combined IAM, RDS, S3, and Elastic Beanstalk from AWS to deploy the app. In addition, I used circleCi for continuous integration and continuous deployment.

### Dependencies

```
- Node v16.0.0

- npm 7.10.0

- AWS CLI v2

- A RDS database running Postgres: [(database-1.c0xnztczwrhr.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com)]

- A S3 bucket for hosting uploaded pictures: [(http://bucket002398.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/home)] - this is the endpoint to launch for the hosted working frontend application

Screenshot of application is in docs folder.
