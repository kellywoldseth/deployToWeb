# Hosting a Full-Stack Application

## Description: Given starter code of a mock app called "Udagram" modeled after Instagram, I used AWS RDS (to host a database), S3 (to store uploaded pictures), and Elastic Beanstalk (to host server) to deploy the web site. In addition, I used circleCi for continuous integration and deployment.

### Dependencies

```
- Node v16.0.0

- npm 7.10.0

- AWS CLI v2

- A RDS database running Postgres: [(database-1.c0xnztczwrhr.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com)]

- A S3 bucket for hosting uploaded pictures: [(http://bucket002398.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/home)] - this is the endpoint to launch for the hosted working frontend application
```

Screenshot of application is in docs folder.
